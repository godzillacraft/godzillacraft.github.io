We worshipped him all day all day. We even had a Wikia dedicated to him. He was a stuffed animal dog with a big heart. He was a major scammer in his youth however; he turned to religion to help the poor. He founded the major religion that we all know about titled &ldquo;Lafsalonian&rdquo;. He made it so we could all could live a wholesome life, and it did just that. Almost a billion people joined Lafsalonian. In the 17</span><span class="c0 c17">th</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Century it had 996 million followers. Lafsalonian only has twenty-two million followers today. However, Lafsalonian is not dying by any means. Thirty years ago Lafsalonian had only 3.5 million followers. In 2006 the trend of Lafsalonian followers leaving stopped. Lafsalonian started gaining followers. Lafsalot&rsquo;s spirit was amazed. So was Leonardo&rsquo;s (Lafsalot&rsquo;s son).

He was born in Rome as the eldest son to Elisabeth and Sir Lafsalot I out of seven children. He is seen as a religious figure, following mostly in Christianity and following the works of Jesus Christ. He created his religious group in 1582 that titled Lafsalonian. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c16">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early Life</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Lafsalot came from royalty in Greece.

I&rsquo;ll tell you a story about how Lafsalonian was founded. So it was a stormy day in Greece; which is where Lafsalot came from. Lafsalot couldn&rsquo;t scam anymore because he was a King. </span><span class="c12 c14">So he founded a major scam; that was obviously Lafsalonian.</span><span class="c12">&nbsp; Lafsalot stepped down as King to serve the Church full time. Lafsalot started with smaller </span><span class="c12 c14">scams</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;acts of kindness.

Until one day, he met someone who would join his religion. His name was Dante Prasscott. Dante would later become a Priest in Lafsalonian. People were finally joining Lafsalonian! Everything was going great for Lafsalot. He met a woman named Rihannon Sade. Lafsalot and Rihannon got married. Lafsalot had three children, Leonardo, Friedanne, and Sereen. Lafsalot later divorced Rihannon. Rihannon passed away because of the common cold not long after the divorce. Everything kept going great until one day. Lafsalot became very ill. Lafsalot sadly passed away January 7, 1723. His last words in bodily form were, &ldquo;Sto pn&eacute;vma mou p&aacute;nta tha e&iacute;nai, s&yacute;mfona me to Pn&eacute;vma An&eacute;kathen &iacute;moun.&rdquo; Translated to English this means &ldquo;In the Spirit I always will be, in the Spirit I always have been.&rdquo; Lafsalot&rsquo;s body then disappeared and Lafsalot&rsquo;s spirit form was seen by the witnesses. His spirit form looks exactly like his body but, he can do much more in his spirit form. Lafsalot carried on as the ruler of Lafsalonian until Leonardo was 21. When Leonardo turned 21, Lafsalot stepped down as High Priest of Lafsalonian. Lafsalonian was carried on by Leonardo however; Leonardo faced many hardships like the critique of Lafsalonian by Michael Prat-Washington. Lafsalot then proceeded to ask Michael if he would try out Lafsalonian but without any of the monetary obligations. He did not try out Lafsalonian. Michael Prat-Washington had twenty-eight children. We only know about 25 of them, which are Johanna, Scott, and the infamous Elbarque. Elbarque tried to assassinate many Lafsalonian followers. Michael Prat-Washington was later executed by the Greek State. Lafsalot said he opposed the execution, </span><span class="c5 c14">even though he did not oppose it. He was just saying it to make himself look good.</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;On January 5, 1754, Leonardo was the target of an attempted assassination by Elbarque. Elbarque hit Leonardo in the right shoulder. Leonardo was taken to AHEPA University Hospital. Leonardo had children, the most famous being Leonardo II. Leonardo II attended the law school at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki; just like his Grandfather. Leonardo II became the best lawyer in the country of Greece. Lafsalot II now enjoys golfing. Here is a picture of him golfing.</span></p><p class="c7 c10"><span class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 300.00px; height: 225.33px;"><img alt="" spg" style="width: 300.00px; height: 225.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c10 c7"><span class="c5">Lafsalot II is still a part of Lafsalonian in his spirit form. </span></p><p class="c10 c7 c6"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c10 c7"><span class="c1">The Story of Leonardo Casper Outside of the Church of Lafsalonian (An Even Shorter Story in a Different Font!)</span></p><p class="c10 c7 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c7" id="h.ljobmrsscong"><span class="c12 c13 c15">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c13">Leonardo Casper was born</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">August 9, 1571. He grew up in the family of Lafsalot. Leonardo never met his uncles Bartholomew, and Daniel because they left the Church. Lafsalot didn&rsquo;t understand why they left the Church. Leonardo grew up playing lots of sports such as rugby union and volleyball. Leonardo could have grown up to be a professional volleyball player but, Leonardo wanted to serve the Church. Lafsalot stepped down on as High Priest of the Lafsalonian Church on the day Leonardo turned 21. Leonardo played volleyball a lot. He even went to the finals of his volleyball league. In the game Leonardo played setter. Leonardo&rsquo;s team won the game. Leonardo, of course, carried his team. Leonardo&rsquo;s team stared at him in disbelief. He recalls his teammate Bobby saying, &ldquo;What? How could a dog do this? I am now going to convert to Lafsalonian!&rdquo; Leonardo looked up to the crowd and smiled at his father, Lafsalot.</span></p><p class="c10 c7 c6" id="h.o05j8362siqt"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c10 c7 c6" id="h.3coa7vx1tnrw"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c10 c7" id="h.8p95n6nl54qs"><span class="c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By: godzillacraft</span></p><p class="c10 c7 c6" id="h.emkx9ggam1eo"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c10 c7 c6" id="h.a1pdb4a6yh17"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c10 c7" id="h.gjdgxs"><span class="c4">For more information about Lafsalot go to: lafsalot.wikia.com</span></p><p class="c10 c7 c6"><span class="c12 c22"></span></p><p class="c10 c7 c6"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c10 c7 c6"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c10 c7"><span class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p></body></html>
